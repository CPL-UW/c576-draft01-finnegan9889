The game I'm making is a food-themed card game that uses procedural generation. 
The learning objective of this game is some basic nutritional concepts in the context of exercise (more in terms of diets associated with exercise goals, not the exercise itself). 

Progress/Issues
While the educational concepts of the game has been consistent throughout development so far, the execution in terms of what the gameplay will look like has not been. Ideas have been scrapped multiple times to try to create a more fun experience without losing focus on the learning objective. That being said, the core functionality of the game mechanics are there, but it doesn't quite feel like a game yet. I still need to implement some game control in the form of rules as well as the procedural generation.
